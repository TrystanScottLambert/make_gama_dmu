This DMU provides the final GAMA Galaxy Group Catalogue (G3C) which includes the
GAMA III equatorial and G23 survey regions. The G3C is one of the
major data products of the GAMA project. At the most basic level it
is a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group catalogue that has been run on
GAMA survey style mocks (put together by Peder Norberg and various
collaborators in Durham) to test the quality of the grouping and then
run on the real GAMA data in order to extract our best effort
groups. This version of the group catalogue is built using the 
"Nessie" group finder which implements the FoF algorithm.
The details of the process are discussed extensively in
Robotham et al. (2011) and Lambert et al. (2025). 

This DMU necessarily produces several catalogues. Below we discuss the
catalogues contained in the DMU. For most user purposes G3CGal and
G3CFoFGroup will be the most useful catalogues.

For all catalogues the null value is -999 unless otherwise stated in
the column descriptions.

The GroupFinding DMU has the following database dependencies:

gkvScienceCat v02
Randoms v02

The exact selection of the galaxies used from gkvScienceCatv02 is:

SELECT UberID,RAcen,Deccen,Z,flux_rl,NQ FROM gkvScienceCatv02 WHERE SC>6

This is different to the selection used in versions <= v10 which relied on the old photometry.

GAMA Group Catalogue (G3C):

G3CGal:
List of all galaxies that were used for GAMA grouping. This catalogue
also contains the group references for grouped galaxies. It also includes
galaxy separations to different definitions of the G3C group centre.

G3CFoFGroup:
List of FoF group properties. The GroupID references in G3CGal link to
this catalogue. Some properties such as the hull-calculations and image urls are no longer
being provided. This catalogue contains the core properties.

G3CGalPair:
List of all galaxy pairs with a projected physical separation of
100 kpc/h and a velocity separation of 1,000 km/s. Note that
G3CGalPair is a pair catalogue that lists each pair only once. It is
quite arbitrary which galaxy is listed first, so be careful to check
both CATAID columns for a galaxy of interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

G3C Mock catalogues:
The G3C mock catalogues will soon be updated to a newer version of the
GAMA mocks which will then also encompass the full volumes of the GAMA II
equatorial and G02 regions. As such the present version of the DMU
does not contain the mock groups.
